# Interface Board

This board serves as a sensor interface on the moving head.

It includes power regulators, GPIO and two communication busses - I2C and SPI.

It communicates with the main board via buffered 12V I2C bus.

## TODO

- add TVS/ESD protection on I2C 12V bus
- (maybe) add protection to GPIO
- LOGOs
- BOM
